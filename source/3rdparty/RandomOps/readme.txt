Installation:

The easiest way to install and use RandomOps with the
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is to mirror the directory
path of the development computer. All the ANSI C libraries
from Hvass Laboratories are located in the following path
on that computer:

  C:\Users\Magnus\Documents\Development\Libraries\HvassLabs-C

To install the RandomOps source-code simply un-zip the
archive to this path, and you should be able to open and
use the MS Visual C++ projects directly.

Please see the RandomOps manual for other installation
alternatives.


Compiler Compatibility:

RandomOps was developed in MS Visual C++ 2005 but should
be compatible with all ANSI C compilers.
